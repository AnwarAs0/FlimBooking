**Project Overview:** Film Ticket Booking Project 
**Project Title:** Film Ticket Booking Project

**Objective:**

The Film Ticket Booking application is an online platform designed to simplify the process of reserving movie tickets. Built using the Spring Boot framework, it offers users a seamless and efficient experience from selecting movies and showtimes to booking tickets and receiving confirmation emails.

**Key Features:**

- **Booking Management:** Users can browse available movies, choose showtimes, and book tickets effortlessly.
- **Automated Confirmation:** Once a booking is made, a JMS-based messaging system handles the asynchronous processing of the booking data. A confirmation email containing booking details is automatically sent to the customer using JavaMailSender.
- **Database Integration:** The application uses MySQL as the backend database to store booking details securely, while JPA and Hibernate are used to ensure smooth interaction between the database and the application.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error-handling mechanisms to ensure reliable delivery of confirmation emails and smooth application performance.
- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user- friendly, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Spring Boot:** Application framework
- **JMS (Java Message Service):** For reliable messaging
- **JavaMailSender:** For sending booking confirmation emails
- **MySQL:** Database for storing booking information
- **JPA & Hibernate:** For ORM and efficient database handling
- **Web Servers:** To deploy and run the web application

**Impact:**

- Ensured a reliable and user-friendly booking process, leading to increased customer satisfaction and reduced errors in bookings.
- The use of JMS and email automation streamlined communication, ensuring timely notifications for users.
